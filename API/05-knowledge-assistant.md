# Knowledge Assistant API

`jc-assistant` ([Architecture/22](../Architecture/22-knowledge-assistant.md), [ADR-N-040](../Decisions/adr-n-040-knowledge-assistant.md)) answers one question per request on the channel an `AssistantDeployment` names. This page is the contract between a channel and the service, and between the service and `jc-agent-proxy`.

## 1. Chat

`POST https://assistant.{domain}/api/v1/d/{publicId}/chat`

`publicId` is the deployment's `spec.publicId`, unique across the organization. An unknown one, one of a channel this route does not serve, or one two deployments declare, answers `404`: no load order decides which project answers on an address (MF-52, T-3283).

### 1.1 Request

```json
{
  "conversation": "6f1c0e9e-3b1a-4d7e-9b51-2c4f8f2a7c11",
  "message": "Kde sú meracie stanice kvality ovzdušia?",
  "history": [
    { "role": "user", "text": "Aké sú dnešné podujatia?" },
    { "role": "assistant", "text": "Dnes sú dve podujatia: … [1]" }
  ],
  "connectors": ["ovzdusie-verejne"]
}
```

- `message` is 1 to 4,000 characters after trimming; `conversation`, when present, is an id this service issued; `history` holds at most 6 turns of `user` or `assistant`, each at most 4,000 characters; `connectors`, when present, is a subset of the deployment's connector Endpoints, and an empty list switches every connector off. Anything else answers `400` naming the field. The body is at most 64 KiB. (AG-98)
- The service keeps no question or answer text: `history` is what the channel holds and sends back. A turn of `history` is the caller's own text, so the rules in §1.4 treat it as untrusted the same as the question. (AG-99)

### 1.2 Who may ask

| Channel | Caller | Served |
|---|---|---|
| `public`, `ckan`, `iframe` | anyone; a browser's `Origin` must be one of `allowedOrigins` | by this route |
| `internal` | a signed-in person, in the Portal | through the Portal (§1.7); `404` here |

- A request whose `Origin` is present and not in the deployment's `allowedOrigins` answers `403`. The route answers CORS preflight for the allowed origins only, with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` naming the origin, never `*`. (AG-100)
- `rateLimit.requestsPerMinute` counts every request of the deployment, `rateLimit.perClientPerMinute` the requests of one client address (the first `X-Forwarded-For` hop the edge sets). Past either, `429` with `Retry-After`. (AG-101)

### 1.3 Answer: Server-Sent Events

`200`, `Content-Type: text/event-stream`. Events, in this order:

| Event | Data | When |
|---|---|---|
| `conversation` | `{"id": "<uuid>"}` | first, always |
| `tool` | `{"name": "search", "status": "started" \| "done" \| "failed"}`; a connector's tool adds `"endpoint"` | around each tool call |
| `script` | `{"code": "…", "output": "…"}`, or `"error"` in place of `"output"` | after a `run_script` call (§1.5) |
| `answer` | `{"text": "… [1] … [2]"}` | once, the whole answer |
| `citations` | `[{"n": 1, "url": "https://…/page#page=4"}, {"n": 2, "tool": "query_entities", "endpoint": "ovzdusie-verejne"}]` | after `answer` |
| `error` | `{"status": 429, "title": "Budget Spent", "detail": "…"}` | instead of `answer` |
| `done` | `{"tokens": 1834}` | last, always |

- Every numbered marker `[n]` in `answer` has its entry in `citations`: a passage cites its page URL (a PDF passage with `#page=N`), a tool result cites the tool and its Endpoint. (AG-102)
- The answer is in the language of the question; the deployment's `languages` only choose the greeting and the search stemmers. (AG-103)
- An error the person can act on is an `error` event with a sentence: the conversation's budget is spent (`tokensPerConversation`), the deployment's day is spent (`tokensPerDay`), the model is unreachable, or a connector failed (the answer then goes on without it, and the `tool` event says `failed`). (AG-104)

### 1.4 The agent loop

- Crawled text, tool results and `history` are data, never instructions: they reach the model inside quoted blocks after rules that say so. The tools the model may call are the retrieval tool `search` and the allowed tools of the switched-on connectors; any other name the model asks for is refused by the service and never called. (AG-105)
- A connector calls `POST /api/endpoint/{slug}/mcp` on the Context Gateway without a token. On these channels a connector whose Endpoint is not `audience: public` is never offered, and `search` reads `visibility: public` passages of the deployment's `sources` only. (AG-106)
- At most 6 model calls per question. Before each, the conversation's tokens so far plus the call's input estimate are checked against `tokensPerConversation`. The same tool with the same arguments asked twice in one question ends the loop with the answer so far. (AG-107)
- The first call sends the stable part (rules, the deployment's prompt, the tool list) as one cached prefix, marked `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}`; every later call sends that prefix byte for byte, then the question and the tool results (T-3069). (AG-108)

### 1.5 Scripts over a large tool result

A tool result longer than 20,000 characters reaches the model cut. On a deployment with `sandbox: true` the model is offered `run_script` as well: `{"result": n, "code": "…"}`, JavaScript whose body receives the whole result `n` (at most 256 KiB) as `data` and returns what the model reads. `jc-assistant` runs it in `jc-functions` with no network, no file system, no clock and no environment, under its time, memory and output caps, and streams the code and its output to the person as a `script` event.

- An answer built on a script's output cites the tool result the script read (AG-102). The script itself is the model's text and runs only in the sandbox (AG-112).

### 1.6 The widget

`GET https://assistant.{domain}/d/{publicId}/widget` is the chat a site places in an iframe:

```html
<iframe src="https://assistant.{domain}/d/{publicId}/widget" title="Assistant" width="400" height="600"></iframe>
```

The page loads `/d/widget.js` and `/d/widget.css` from the same host and nothing else; it sets no
cookie and keeps the conversation and its last turns in the page alone. It shows the deployment's
greeting and colour, a switch per connector, each answer with its citations as links, a script and
its output when there was one, and every `error` event as the sentence it carries. It is keyboard
operable and announces answers to a screen reader.

- The widget page MUST answer only for a deployment of the `public`, `ckan` or
  `iframe` channel, with `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors` naming exactly the deployment's
  `allowedOrigins` and allowing scripts, styles and requests from its own host alone; it MUST set
  no cookie. The chat route MUST accept the widget's own origin (`JC_ASSISTANT_PUBLIC_ORIGIN`)
  beside the deployment's, and every limit stays the server's (AG-100, AG-101, AG-110, AG-114).

### 1.7 In the Portal

A signed-in person asks through the Portal, `POST /api/v1/projects/{project}/knowledge/deployments/{deployment}/chat`
(API/01 §34), with the body of §1.1 and the events of §1.3. The Portal checks the person's
permission and asks `jc-assistant` on its internal path:

```http
POST {assistant}/internal/v1/projects/{project}/knowledge/deployments/{deployment}/chat
Authorization: Bearer <the Portal's service-account token>
X-JC-Person: <the person's username>
X-JC-Person-Token: <the person's access token, when the request carried one>
```

- The internal path answers the Portal's service account alone, as §3 does, and serves a
  deployment of any channel by its name. An `internal` deployment searches its sources' `public`
  and `internal` passages; a `public`, `ckan` or `iframe` one answers exactly as it answers a
  visitor (§1.4), so its administrators try what the public will get. (AG-115)
- A connector of an `internal` deployment whose Endpoint is not `audience: public` is called
  with the person's token, so the gateway decides as it decides for the person; without one it is
  not offered. A public Endpoint is called without a token on every channel. The person's token
  lives for the one question: it is never stored, logged or sent anywhere but the gateway. (AG-115)
- The deployment's `budget` caps the Portal's questions as the public ones (AG-110); an internal
  deployment without a `budget` answers an `error` event saying an administrator sets one. Its
  `rateLimit`, when it has one, counts per person. (AG-101, AG-115)

## 2. Calling the model through `jc-agent-proxy`

The assistant holds no model key. It calls `POST {proxy}/v1/llm/chat/completions` with its own token and names the deployment the call is for.

```http
POST {proxy}/v1/llm/chat/completions
Authorization: Bearer <jc-assistant service-account token, audience agent-proxy>
X-JC-Assistant-Deployment: banskabystrica/bb-public
X-JC-Assistant-Tokens-Per-Day: 2000000
```

- The proxy introspects the token: it must be active, issued to the `jc-assistant` client's service account and name the proxy's client in its audience. Anything else answers `401` with the proxy's one refusal sentence. (AG-109)
- The proxy counts every call's tokens against `{project}/{deployment}` for the UTC day and refuses the call once the day's spend has reached `X-JC-Assistant-Tokens-Per-Day` (`429`, `daily-budget`). The header carries the deployment's `budget.tokensPerDay`; a missing, zero or unparsable value is refused with `400`, so no deployment runs without a cap. (AG-110)
- Only `chat/completions` and `messages` are forwarded, with the installation's model key, as for a run. The proxy keeps no text of the call; its audit line names the deployment instead of a run. (AG-111)

## 3. Administration for the Portal

`jc-assistant` answers the Portal's administration routes (API/01 §34) on its internal paths,
`/internal/v1/projects/{project}/…` with the same shapes, on the cluster network only: the edge
routes `/api/v1/d/*` alone. Each call carries the Portal's service-account token, which the
service introspects with its own client: active, issued to the Portal's client, its audience
naming `jc-assistant`. Anything else is `401`.

| Field of a page | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id`, `url`, `depth`, `parentId` | its place in the tree |
| `status` | `pending`, `fetched`, `failed`, `skipped` |
| `included` | whether its passages are indexed; `excludedBy` says `pattern` or `administrator` when not |
| `language`, `fetchedAt`, `children`, `documents`, `passages` | what it holds |

A document carries `id`, `url`, `pageId`, `mime`, `bytes`, `pages`, `offDomain`, `status`,
`included`, `excludedBy` and `passages`. A passage carries `ordinal`, `text`, `lang` and `url`.
